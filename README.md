## Development

The required Node.js and Yarn versions are listed in the `package.json` file. 

You can run `nvm use` and `yvm use` from the project root if you have [Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [Yarn version manager](https://yvm.js.org)s installed to select the correct version.
